### Update in Oct 2017:
*	Thank [hotcap](https://github.com/hotcap) for adding [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com) to our list. See [this pull request](https://github.com/njuljsong/wsjUnblock/pull/7) for details.

### Update in Aug 2017:
*	Thank [apank](https://github.com/apank) for adding [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek) to our list.
*	Thank [strafer](https://github.com/strafer) for creating an issue that [New York Times Cooking section](https://cooking.nytimes.com/) has separate paywall. We fixed it by just injecting CSS to the pages to hide the pop up dialog and still keep JavaScript working as expected. See [this pull request](https://github.com/njuljsong/wsjUnblock/pull/3) for details.

### Update in Apr 2017:
*	**Fact**: WSJ has an advertisement popping up *every single time* we read an article, too much!
*	**Idea**: After checking their code, I find the pop-up ad is triggered by a javascript file, so let's just block it, using the same logic that we blocked the NYTimes gateway javascript.
*	**Extra**: The pop-up ad will stay disappeared as long as the WSJ developers do not change the javascript names, I am sure they will at some point. So this is a practical but not ideal solution for right now.

### Update in Jan 2017:
*	**Fact**: WSJ has blocked `https://www.google.com` referer randomly on desktop.

*	**Idea**: I changed the referer to facebook or twitter, both are working great again:). The logic is that we can read the full WSJ article if we click through a twitter or facebook link of the article. So far they have not blocked these referers.

*	**Extra**: Add Financial Times `www.ft.com` to our list. FT and WSJ are using the same logic for paywall, so it can be accessed in the same way.

### How It Works as in July 2016:

#### For Wall Street Journal:
*  **Fact**: WSJ full content can be accessed if the content link is clicked from google search result page.

*  **Idea**: Set the following headers for the link you click:
	* `Referer: https://www.google.com`
	* `Cookie: <NONE>`

*  **Reference**: The logic is copied from [wsj-walljumper](https://github.com/hatboysam/wsj-walljumper)

#### For New York Times:
*  **Fact**: NYTimes pops up subscription window and blocks content view after you read 10 pieces/month, clearly they use Javascript to do the trick.

*  **Idea**:  Block those Javascript files from downloading :)

*  **Suggestion For NYTimes Developers**: concatenate the minified Javascript files, and maybe attach a random string in your concatenated Javascript filename?

#### Interested in development process?
*	I wrote a blog [How to bypass WSJ and NYTimes paywalls?](http://blog.jinsongli.com/) about the details on my website.
